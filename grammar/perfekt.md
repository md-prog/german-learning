# Das Perfekt (The Present Perfect Tense)

In spoken German, the Perfekt tense is used much more frequently than the simple past (Präteritum) to talk about completed actions. It's similar to the English "I have done" or "I did."

The Perfekt tense is formed with two parts:

- A helping verb (Auxiliary verb): usually haben (to have) or sometimes sein (to be).
- The Partizip II (Past Participle) of the main verb.

The helping verb is conjugated and stands in the second position in the sentence, while the Partizip II goes at the very end of the sentence.

## 1. Forming the Partizip II (Past Participle)

This is the trickiest part, as there are regular and irregular verbs.

### Regular Verbs (Weak Verbs):

Add "ge-" at the beginning and "-t" at the end of the verb stem.

    machen (to make) → gemacht
    kaufen (to buy) → gekauft
    spielen (to play) → gespielt

### Irregular Verbs (Strong Verbs):

These often change their stem vowel and end in "-en". They typically also start with "ge-".

    gehen (to go) → gegangen
    kommen (to come) → gekommen
    essen (to eat) → gegessen
    trinken (to drink) → getrunken

(Note: There are also verbs that don't take "ge-" if they have certain prefixes, but we'll cover that later.)

## 2. Choosing the Helping Verb: haben or sein

This is a crucial rule!

### Most verbs use haben.

These are typically verbs that take a direct object (transitive verbs) or verbs of no motion.

Examples:

    Ich habe gegessen. (I have eaten.) / Wir haben gespielt. (We have played.)

### `Sein` is used for:

- Verbs of motion to a destination (e.g., gehen, fahren, fliegen, kommen).
- Verbs that describe a change of state (e.g., einschlafen - to fall asleep, sterben - to die, wachsen - to grow).
- The verbs `sein (to be)` itself, and `bleiben (to stay)`.

Examples:
    
    Ich bin gegangen. (I have gone.) / Er ist gefahren. (He has driven.) / Wir sind gewesen. (We have been.)

Sentence Structure in Perfekt:

    `Subject + conjugated helping verb + ... + Partizip II (at the end)`

    Ich habe einen Apfel gegessen. (I have eaten an apple.)
    Wir sind nach Hause gegangen. (We have gone home.)
